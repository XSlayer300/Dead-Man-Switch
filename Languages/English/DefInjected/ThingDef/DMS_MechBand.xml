  <DMS_BandNode.description>An array machine amplifier processes the received signals that direct it to a specific mechanitor. This will add 4 bandwidths to that mechanitor's total bandwidth, allowing them to control more mechanoids.\n\nOnce the processing array is constructed, it can be quickly tuned to a mechanitor. However, retuning a processing array to a different mechanitor takes significantly longer.\n\nThis machine follows the encrypted NACS protocol, so only mechlinks or mech transceivers following the protocol can receive the service.</DMS_BandNode.description>
